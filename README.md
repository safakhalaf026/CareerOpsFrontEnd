# 📊 CareerOps

CareerOps is a full-stack job application tracking and analytics platform built using RESTful conventions. It helps users manage their job applications, track progress across hiring stages, schedule follow-ups, and gain data-driven insights into their job search through an interactive analytics dashboard.

---

## 🧩 About the Project
CareerOps was designed to solve a common problem faced by job seekers: keeping track of multiple applications across different companies, stages, and sources. The platform allows users to log applications, update their progress over time, and record upcoming actions such as follow-ups or interviews.

Beyond basic tracking, CareerOps provides a personalized analytics dashboard that visualizes application data using charts and KPIs. Users can quickly understand how many applications are active, where they are getting rejected, which sources perform best, and how long it typically takes to hear back from employers.
